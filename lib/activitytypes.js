Most social networking applications, for example, provide individual users with their own dedicated "profile" pages. Several allow similar types of pages to be created for commercial entities, organizations or events. While the specific details of how pages are implemented, their characteristics and use may vary, the one unifying property is that they are typically "owned" by a single entity that is represented by the content provided by the page itself.'
